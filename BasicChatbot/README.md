# CodeAlpha – Python Programming Tasks  
## Project Title: Basic Chatbot

### Objective:
To develop a simple **rule-based chatbot** in Python that interacts with users using predefined responses to common greetings and questions.

---

### Key Concepts Used:
- **if-elif-else statements** for decision making  
- **Functions** for modular chatbot responses  
- **Loops** for continuous user interaction  
- **String manipulation** (`.lower()`, `in`)  
- **Input/Output** for user communication  

---

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **IDE:** PyCharm (or any Python IDE)  
- **Platform:** Console-based program  

---

### Project Description:
This is a simple text-based chatbot that engages in basic conversation.  
It accepts user input, checks for known phrases (like greetings or questions), and replies using predefined responses.

**Features:**
- Responds to greetings such as “hello” or “hi”  
- Answers “how are you” with a friendly response  
- Introduces itself when asked for its name  
- Says goodbye when the user types “bye”  
- Provides a help message for supported commands  
- Runs continuously until the user exits

### Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Writing interactive console-based programs  
- Implementing conditional logic using `if-elif-else`  
- Handling continuous input/output loops in Python  

It also gave me confidence in creating user-friendly, text-based applications.
